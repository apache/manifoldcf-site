    <h1>Verifying ManifoldCF releases</h1>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>To verify ManifoldCF releases after version 1.6, you will need OpenPGP, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/download/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Verifying a release</h2>
<h3>Importing the public keys</h3>
<p>Each release comes with a KEYS file. Before you can verify the release artifacts, you must import the KEYS file into OpenPGP.</p>
<p>Start by downloading the KEYS file for the release to your local machine. Be sure that you download this file from an Apache server -- not a mirror, or third-party server, but from <a href="http://www.apache.org">www.apache.org</a> itself. If you want, you can also verify that the contents of the KEYS file consists only of public keys that have been registered with various key authorities, such as <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/">MIT's</a>.</p>
<p>Next, load the KEYS file into OpenPGP, using a command like this:</p>
<p><code>gpg --import KEYS</code></p>
<p>Perform the most basic level of verification by downloading the ASC signature file for the artifact, and then running a command such as this (good for both Windows and Unix):</p>
<p><code>gpg --verify apache-manifoldcf-X.X.X-src.tar.gz.asc</code></p>
<h3>Verifying the MD5 signature</h3>
<p>To verify the MD5 signature of a release, download the artifact and the MD5 signature file for the artifact, and then run a Unix command such as this:</p>
<p><code>gpg --print-md MD5 apache-manifoldcf-X.X.X-src.tar.gz | diff - apache-manifoldcf-X.X.X-src.tar.gz.md5</code></p>
<p>On Windows:</p>
<p><code>gpg --print-md MD5 apache-manifoldcf-X.X.X-src.tar.gz &gt; capture.md5</code><br/><code>fc capture.md5 apache-manifoldcf-X.X.X-src.tar.gz.md5</code></p>
<p>No differences will be printed if the signatures agree. If there are differences, then validity of the release cannot be verified.</p>
<h3>Verifying an SHA signature</h3>
<p>To verify the SHA signature of a release, download the artifact and the SHA signature file for the artifact, and then run a Unix command such as this:</p>
<p><code>gpg --print-md SHA512 apache-manifoldcf-X.X.X-src.tar.gz | diff - apache-manifoldcf-X.X.X-src.tar.gz.sha</code></p>
<p>On Windows:</p>
<p><code>gpg --print-md SHA512 apache-manifoldcf-X.X.X-src.tar.gz &gt; capture.sha</code><br/><code>fc capture.sha apache-manifoldcf-X.X.X-src.tar.gz.sha</code></p>
<p>No differences will be printed if the signatures agree. If there are differences, then validity of the release cannot be verified.</p>
