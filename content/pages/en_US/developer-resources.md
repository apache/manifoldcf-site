# ManifoldCF - Developer Resources

## Source Code

The source files are stored using Subversion (see [http://subversion.tigris.org/](http://subversion.tigris.org/) and  [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/))

`svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/manifoldcf/trunk mcf-trunk`

A read-only Git hub is also available for those who use Git. The URL for Git is:

`git://git.apache.org/manifoldcf.git`

## Debugging Connections

Sooner or later, you will encounter a repository that should be supported, but doesn't seem to want to connect properly to ManifoldCF. When that happens, you will need all the help you can get. Start [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CONNECTORS/Debugging+Connections), and if you find a new hint, technique, or trick, don't forget to add it to the page!

## Changes List

Current changes list (as of the most recent nightly build) is available  [here](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/manifoldcf/trunk/CHANGES.txt).	

## Reporting a Bug, Problem, or Feature Request

If you think you've found a problem, or you just have a good idea for an improvement, you can create a JIRA ticket [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CONNECTORS/). You may need to create yourself an account. 

Please make every effort to search through the current issues list before creating a new ticket. Your problem might already have been logged!

## Making a Contribution

ManifoldCF is always looking for contributions. See the [Wiki](http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CONNECTORS/HowToContribute) for details on contributing. 

We're also looking for logo ideas. Here are the [guidelines](http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CONNECTORS/Logo+Criteria).
